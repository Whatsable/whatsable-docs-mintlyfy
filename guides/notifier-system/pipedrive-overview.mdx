    <Frame caption="WhatsAble Integration Panel">
      <img src="/images/contact_integration_panel.png" alt="WhatsAble Integration Panel" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding the Integration Panel

The WhatsAble Integration panel displays the same connection information as in deals:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="WhatsAble License Status" icon="circle-check">
    Confirms your subscription is active
  </Card>
  <Card title="Synced WhatsApp Account" icon="link">
    Shows which WhatsApp Business account is connected
  </Card>
  <Card title="WhatsApp Connection Status" icon="signal-bars">
    Indicates if your WhatsApp connection is active
  </Card>
  <Card title="Last WhatsApp Communication" icon="clock">
    Displays the date and time of the most recent message
  </Card>
  <Card title="WhatsAble Chat URL" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    Provides a direct link to the conversation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sending Options

The same three options are available:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Live Chat" icon="messages">
    Opens the WhatsAble chat interface directly within Pipedrive
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send Scheduled Message" icon="clock">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Send Template" icon="paper-plane">
