# Notifyer System Integration with n8n

This guide explains how to connect Notifyer System with n8n to create powerful automated WhatsApp messaging workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Notifyer System account ([Sign up](https://notifyer.app/signup))
- An active subscription plan with Notifyer (Monthly or Pay-as-you-go)
- An n8n account ([Create one if needed](https://n8n.io))

## Setting up your Notifyer System account

### Step 1: Complete the Embedding Process

Before you can send WhatsApp messages, you must first complete the platform embedding process, which connects your WhatsApp Business account to Notifyer System.

> **Note**: The embedding process is required by Meta to ensure proper business verification and compliance with WhatsApp Business Platform policies.

### Step 2: Set up message templates

Notifyer System provides two methods for sending WhatsApp messages:

#### Option A: Template messages

WhatsApp templates are pre-approved message formats that allow for personalization while maintaining compliance with WhatsApp policies.

1. Navigate to **Your Templates** in your Notifyer dashboard
2. Click the **Create Template** tab at the top of the page
3. Fill out the template creation form:
   - **Template Name**: Choose a descriptive name for internal reference
   - **Category**: Select the appropriate message category
   - **Language**: Choose your template's primary language
   - **Message Body**: Craft your message content
   - **Variables**: Add placeholders using `{{1}}`, `{{2}}` format for personalization
   - **Header** (Optional): Add an image, document, or video header
   - **Footer** (Optional): Add a standard footer message
   - **Buttons** (Optional): Configure call-to-action buttons

4. Click **Preview and Submit**

After submission, Facebook will review your template. Once approved, it will appear in the **Templates** tab adjacent to the **Create Template** tab.

> **Tip**: Templates typically get reviewed within 24 hours. Creating compliant templates that avoid promotional language increases approval chances.

#### Option B: Non-template messages

For simpler communications, you can send non-template messages that include:
- Plain text
- Images
- Documents
- Videos

> **Note**: Non-template messages can only be sent within the 24-hour customer service window after a customer initiates contact with your business.

### Step 3: Get your API key

To connect Notifyer System with n8n, you'll need an API key:

1. In your Notifyer dashboard, navigate to **API Keys**
2. Copy your unique API key (keep this secure - it provides access to your WhatsApp messaging)
