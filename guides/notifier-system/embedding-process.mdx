## Overview

Notifyer System enables businesses to send automated WhatsApp messages to customers through a direct integration with the WhatsApp Business Platform. This guide walks you through the embedding process to connect your WhatsApp Business Account with Notifyer System.

<Note>
  This process uses Meta's Embedded Signup flow, which allows you to create or connect your WhatsApp Business Account directly within Notifyer System.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

<Check>
  Active Notifyer System account with a subscription plan or pay-as-you-go credit
</Check>

<Check>
  Meta Business Portfolio (or willingness to create one during the process)
</Check>

<Check>
  A phone number that isn't currently associated with any WhatsApp account
</Check>

<Warning>
  The phone number you use for your WhatsApp Business Account cannot have an existing WhatsApp account associated with it. If you're using a number that already has WhatsApp, you'll need to delete that account or use a different number.
