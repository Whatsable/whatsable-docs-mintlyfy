# Notifier Integration with n8n

Notifier enables you to send automated WhatsApp messages through your favorite workflow automation tools. This guide walks you through integrating Notifier with n8n to create powerful messaging workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- A Notifier account ([Sign up here](https://notifier.app/signup))

- An n8n account ([Create one if needed](https://n8n.io))

## Set up your Notifier account

### Step 1: Configure your business information

First, let's set up your business profile in Notifier:

1. Log in to your Notifier dashboard
2. Navigate to **Business Information**
3. Complete all required fields:
   - **Business Name**: Enter the name that will appear in messages sent to recipients
   - **Business Website or Social Media**: Add your website or social media URL
   - **Preferred Language**: Select the language for standard WhatsApp message elements

> **Note:** After entering your WhatsApp number, Notifier will send a verification code to this number. Enter the code to verify ownership.

Once saved, you'll see a preview of how your messages will appear to recipients. The actual message structure may vary slightly based on variables and attachments you include.

**Multiple WhatsApp numbers?** You only need to verify your primary business number. Additional numbers can be added without verification.

1. Log in to your n8n account
2. Create a new workflow by clicking **+ New Workflow**
